## Introduction

Breakout is a game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball to break bricks. The objective is to clear all the bricks from the screen using the ball and paddle.

## Features

- Classic Breakout gameplay experience
- Randomly spawning power-ups (e.g., multiball, key)
- Paddle resizing based on game events (e.g., losing a heart, reaching a certain score)
- Locked bricks that require a key power-up to break
- Victory state when all bricks are cleared
- Game over state when all lives are lost

## Controls

- **Left Arrow**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow**: Move paddle right

## Installation

To run the game, you need to have Love2D framework installed on your system. You can download Love2D from [the official website](https://love2d.org/).
